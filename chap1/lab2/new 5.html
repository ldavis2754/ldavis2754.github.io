        <p>When you are making a website, you need to plan on what kind of
                website you want. You need to find out how to format the website
                for the type of website you are making. Then, you need to code 
                the language for the website, and then you have to validate it,
                to see if there any errors.</p>

        <p>I learned how to create a basic webpage in a text editor. I used
            HTML elements to make the structure of the webpage.</p>
